          <p>I started my career in 2007</p>
          <p>
            The main driver was my reading about AJAX. I was amazed by how you can change the parts of the web page without full reload.

        <section>
          <h3>At EPAM, I changed several projects</h3>
          <h4>Without specific naming, let's enumerate them by stacks</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Pure front-end - NWA widgets</li>
            <li>Fullstack for German telecom - JS/Java/Scala</li>
            <li>Front-end with both web and native widgets for TV set-top boxes</li>
            <li>
              React native mobile app (my current project)
              
            </li>
          </ul>

        <section>
          <h3>Widgets for Netvibes.com</h3>
          <p>You write it once and then it can be exported to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Netbives</li>
            <li>iGoogle (remember that Google homepage? üòÅ)</li>

        <section>
          <h3>On to the JVM world...</h3>
          <p>My next project was mature and established set of J2EE applications for German telecom company.</p>
          <p>
            Main customers of this app were the employees of the company.

          <h3>The stack</h3>
          <p>The stack was mainly:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Java 1.5</li>
            <li>Oracle</li>
            <li>Web pages were server rendered with JSP</li>
            <li>
              JBOSS and Weblogic as an application servers
              
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>But it was more interesting than that...</h3>
          <p>
            Not long before my arrival to the project there were attempts to introduce some
            newer elements into that stack.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further, after I joined the project, I influenced on some other changes.
            
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>What we ended up with was:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Scala with Lift/Play frameworks (either front-end or REST endpoints)</li>
            <li>Sometimes newer Java (up to 1.8)</li>
            <li>MongoDB for some prototypes for non-relational storage</li>
            <li>SPA model for some apps (some were better left as a server rendered pages)</li>
            <li>
              Oracle (that was the idea - to preserve data platform)
              
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Radical shift to different UI paradigm</h3>
          <p><span>
              On EPAM's <a href='https://events.epam.com/events/js-open-day-epam'>
              Javascript Open Day</a>, I've heard about project where UI for TV set top boxes are built with web technologies.

          </h2>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Actually, while I was on project, the stack changed</h3>
          <p>Initial one was:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_WebKit">QTWebkit</a> without any browser chrome</li>
            <li>React-based SPA loaded into browser window</li>
            <li>Middleware JS layer to translate data model into requests and event updates</li>
            <li>Linux</li>
            <li>
              Native modules
              
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>But after a few months, the stack became quite radically different</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>UI is composed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_Foundation_Libraries">EFL</a> widgets with JS bindings</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/wayland-project/weston">Weston</a> is used as display server and composite window manager</li>
            <li>Node.js runs JS in which business logic and UI control are written</li>
            <li>Services are run with systemd</li>
            <li>
              ...on top of <a href="https://www.yoctoproject.org/">Yocto</a> project Linux distribution

          <h3>After more than 1.5 years, I switched projects again</h3>

            <li>Task scheduler for notifications</li>
            <li>Introduction of feature flags into platform</li>

        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Task scheduler for notifications</h3>
          <h6>The task is quite abstract and may appear in many forms</h6>
          <p>The goal was to allow only one notification at a time to be displayed on screen.</p>
          <p>It may be displayed for arbitrary period of time.</p>
          <p>New notifications should be put in FIFO order.</p>
          <p>
            Each notification also has a priority that should be respected.
            
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>How it was implemented</h3>
          <p>What was used is scheduler that has following elements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Slot for currently displayed notification</li>
            <li>Priority queue of incoming tasks</li>
            <li>Task as a chained sequence of intervals, each one can be aborted</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Priority queue was implemented as a map of lists.</p>
          <p>
            We didn't need heap-based PQ because number of priorities were about 10 and number of entities (all stacked notifications) rarely approached 10-15 in real production.
            
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Introduce feature flags platform</h3>
          <p>The idea was to introduce flags that enable/disable features currently being in development.</p>
          <p>So we could ship code for the feature, but keep it inactivated for production until it's fully complete.</p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, testers and developers can manually flip the flag and preview the feature.
            
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Specifics for trunk-based model</h3>
          <p>As we used <a href="https://www.gerritcodereview.com/">Gerrit</a> for code-review, all changes were delivered as single commits.</p>
          <p>Therefore, splitting large change into several smaller ones required us to keep everything working until final patch lands.</p>
          <p>
            In this regard, feature flags helped.
